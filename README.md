# Problem solving with algorithms and data structures using python Codes and solutions
This repository contains codes from the book Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python 2nd edition by Bradley N. Miller and David L. Ranum

Solutions for some discussion questions and all programming exercises are also included by either directly modifying the codes shown in the text or via a different file

Currently Ch1 - Ch6 are finished and solutions for Ch7 and Ch8 will be updated gradually
