# Problem solving with algorithms and data structures using python Codes and solutions
This repository contains codes from the book Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python 2nd edition by Bradley N. Miller and David L. Ranum

Solutions for some discussion questions and all programming exercises are also included by either directly modifying the codes shown in the text or via a different file

Currently Ch1 - Ch7 are finished and solutions to Ch8 will be updated gradually

The priority queue class from the pythonds module is used in the Shortest Path Problem in Ch7
